h1. The flags of all countries in the world in one sprite

Include 1 css file and have all the worlds' flags on your site. Tell everyone who uses a lot of country flags to use this link, so it will be in everyone's cache!

h2. Example usage:

In the head of your html file:

@<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/lafeber/world-flags-sprite/flags32.css" />@

In the body of your html file:

<pre>
<ul class="f32">
  <li class="flag ar">Argentina</li>
  <li class="flag ar">Australia</li>
  <li class="flag ar">Austria</li>
...
</ul>
</pre>

If a previously visited site uses this same code, the file is already in the cache of the user and doesn't need to be downloaded again.
NB: It won't work in https environments. You can download the css files instead and include them locally instead.
