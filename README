Example usage:

In the head of your html file:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/lafeber/world-flags-sprite/flags32.css" />

In the body of your html file:

<ul class="f32">
  <li class="flag ar">Argentina</li>
  <li class="flag ar">Australia</li>
  <li class="flag ar">Austria</li>
...
</ul>

If a previously visited site uses this same code, the file is already in the cache of the user and doesn't need to be downloaded again.
NB: It won't work in https environments. You can download the css files instead and include them locally instead.
